        <p class="goals"><strong>Goals:</strong> Vickie is determined to find a candidate that not only has the required foundational knowledge to get started with the team but also demonstrates the capacity to grow into a senior team member as the company is growing.

She must also attempt to find this candidate quickly as she is pulling the extra weight for the vacant slot until the new hire is onboarded.</p>
