                <p><em>**Please note there was a slight deviation from an online resume/portfolio to more of an "about me" page in-between M1 and M2.</em></p>
                <p>My content strategy will revolve around the concept of conveying who I am. I will break this down into areas of my life ranging from work to personal. Each of those areas will then be broken down to more individual items. I hope to heavily lean on pictures with light verbiage, if any, to convey the meaning. I will likely use a 1/3 to 2/3 page lay out for the body with full width on top and bottom.</p>
                <p>I will likely have a short introduction towards the beginning, a contact form towards the end as well as links in the footer. As far as features/function, I would like to reserve the right for possibly using a couple cursor hover features: 1) text on the page is somewhat light and darkens with hover, and 2) images slightly enlarge with hover or single click. I have no idea how hard that'll be, but I want to try it. <strong>Would it be inappropriate to have a resume link?</strong></p>
